Hi! This is my pet-sitter app, written in React. 

You can run the dev server like this: 

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn run
```

Register with email & password. Authentication is done using Google Firebase. 

You can send messages to pet-owners if you want to apply as a pet-sitter. This is only a 1-way communication system. Pet owners cannot respond with a message, but rather accept or decline the applicant's request.
